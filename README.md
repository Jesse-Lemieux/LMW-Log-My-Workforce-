# LMW-Log My Workforce

## Description

LMW is a powerful team organization tool that allows you to view, update and delete many different aspects of
your employee roster! It's an integrated node.js app that will prompt you about what needs to be done!


My motivation for this project was intuitivley navigate the mysql database I established for this app. Melding
together the skills I've aquired ove the last few weeks, specifically, the power of mysql and inquirer together!
In this project some of the problems I solved were:
- Adding connection queries and template literals to functions in tandem
- Constrainting foreign keys in mysql tables
- Modularize my code beyond anything I've done before


## Installation

This being a node.js app, you must first make sure your terminal can run this app by aquiring the needed
packages. You will need npm installed, you can read more about that [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm). You will also need Inquirer installed
which you can find [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). You will then need mysql2 found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2). 
Finally, you will need console.table found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table). Once those dependencies are fitted, you're ready to begin usage.

## Usage

To begin, open your terminal within the root directory, or if you're using VS code, open an integrated terminal.
You then type "node index" on the command line to begin.
